<h2>How to Enter</h2>
The entry fee is $50 per person for the season.<br><br>
<h2>How to Win</h2>
There are two pools. The $50 entry fee covers both pools for a total pot of $500. The first is the Season Pool and the second is the Chase Pool.
<br>Season Pool: You are scored based on the accumulated point total after all 36 races in the NASCAR season.<br>Chase Pool: You are scored based on the accumulated point total during the last 10 Chase races. Regardless of how poorly you perform in the
Season Pool you can still win the Chase Pool by performing well during the last 10 races. By this structure, it is possible for a player to win both the season and chase pools.<br>Season Pool and Chase Pool tie breaker(s) will split the winnings equally<br><br>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
Goal: Pick two drivers each week and score points based on how well they finish the race relative to the other players' drivers. This is called Rotisserie pool play.<br> Check the pick order to see when it is your turn to pick drivers.<br>Check the picks
made by other players for that week. When it is your turn to pick, select two different drivers for that race that have not been picked already. NOTE: Only one pick can be in the top 10 in points according to the NASCAR.com Standings. You ARE allowed
to pick two drivers outside the top 10.<br>For the first race of the year, there will be no top 10 drivers<br>You can also pick a wild card driver otherwise known as Dick Trickle. Two Dick Trickles per player for first 26 races only (none for the Chase
Pool). They count as highest finishing un-picked driver once race is finished (bonus points apply). Both picks cannot be Dick Trickle. More than one player can pick a Dick Trickle for any given week, but scoring priority is granted starting with the player
who picked Dick Trickle first.<br>If necessary, you can change your picks by submitting a new entry so long as the new picks(s) do not conflict with other players'.
<br><br>
<h2>Awarding Points/Money</h2>
Each driver will receive points based on his/her finish in each race. The top finisher will get 20 points, the next 19, the next 18, etc. down to 1 point for the lowest finisher. You will be awarded the sum of both drivers points, plus any additional
bonus points.<br>One bonus point will be awarded if a selected driver wins a stage, and another two additional points will be awarded if a selected driver wins the race. A pole point will not be awarded.<br>$3 up for grabs per week<br>$2 will be awarded
to the highest finisher unless there is a tie for first place that week<br>if two or more players tie for first, both first and second place winnings ($3) will be split equally.<br>if there is no tie for first place, then $1 will be awarded to the second
highest finisher unless there is a tie for second place that week.<br> if two or more players tie for second, second place winnings ($1) will be split equally.
<br>Chase and Season winnings will be based off remainder of funds. For example, 60%, 30%, 10% for top 3. (TBD John Goggio)<br>Picks made prior to NASCAR-issued penalties will remain valid (as well as the points associated) while picks made after must
adhere to the new changes. For example, all top 10 drivers are according to the latest nascar standings. If the standings change mid-week (e.g. a penalty issued to a team/driver) then any picks made prior to that change will remain valid.<br>Jeffri-cap
(formerly Dani-cap Patrick)<br>If you pick Jeffrey Earnhardt, you automatically get 4 bonus points as an incentive for picking him, regardless of where he finishes.<br>Selecting Danica is no different than selecting any other driver -- the same rules
apply.<br>She can only be picked by one player per week<br>There is no limit to how many times a player can pick her throughout the season<br>Dick Trickle can apply to Jeffri-cap however the +4 bonus pts will not be counted.<br><br>
<h2>Picking Order
  <br></h2>
It will be up to the group, not the commish, to move the line along<br> The selection order for the next race will be in reverse order of the total points earned for the previous race (the person with the lowest point total picks first; highest point
total picks last).<br>In the event of a weekly tie between two or more players the tied person lowest in the current standings picks first and the tied person highest in the current standings picks last. If two or more players are tied in Standings picking
priority will be granted starting with the person who picked latest the previous week.<br>The picking order will be updated each week. Once the picking order is posted picks can be submitted.
<br>No repicking day of race (unless something unexpected occurs)<br> At the beginning of the year, the picking order will be drawn from the hat<br><br>
<h2>Operations<br></h2>
Standings will be updated prior to the next race.<br> Selections are based on the driver of the car. If a player picks a driver who is suddenly replaced by substitute driver (due to injury, suspension, etc.), the player will still maintain possession
of the car of the original driver for that race. Note: If a substitute driver carries over into the next race (such as Mark Martin driving Tony Stewart's car full time), he will become the new driver of that car. Players also have the option of repicking
so long as their picks do not conflict with other players. Exceptions can be made by the commish.<br><br>
